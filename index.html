    <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Langga_sharlin</h1>
    <h2>You Are My Forever, My Home, My Peace</h2>

    <p>
    My love, today is not just about flowers or chocolates. It is about truth. 
    The truth is, loving you is no longer just kilig or excitement. 
    It is a decision. A commitment. A promise.
    </p>

    <p>
    You are beautiful even when you just wake up. 
    Even without makeup. 
    Your lips, your nose, your chin, your eyes — they are perfect to me. 
    But what makes you even more beautiful is your personality. 
    Your jolly laugh. Your softness. Your strength. 
    Even your sexy body is just a bonus — because your heart is what captured mine.
    </p>

    <p>
    Ga, dili na ni duwa. Dili ni puppy love. 
    I love you seriously. I love you with intention. 
    Maski unsa pa ang challenges nga moabot sa atoa, 
    I promise we will solve them together. 
    Dili ko muhawa kung lisod na. 
    Dili ko muundang kung naay problema.
    </p>

    <p>
    I know there may be serious problems ahead. 
    Life is not always soft. It tests us. 
    But I am ready. Ready to fight for us. 
    Ready to grow. Ready to become the man you deserve.
    </p>

    <p>
    Ikaw akong pahulay. Ikaw akong kalipay. 
    Ikaw akong future. 
    My love is not a game anymore. 
    I am not here to waste time. 
    I am here to build something real. Something lasting.
    </p>

    <p>
    One day, I want to marry you. 
    I want to wake up beside you every morning. 
    I want to remind you everyday that you are the most beautiful woman in my world.
    </p>

    <p>
    Langga_sharlin, I love you more than you know. 
    More than words can explain. 
    More than distance, more than fear, more than anything.
    </p>

    <p>
    Forever yours,
    <br><strong>Your Future Husband ❤️</strong>
    </p>
